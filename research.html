								Much of a protoplanetary disk is thermally controlled by irradiation from the central star. Such a disk, long thought to have a smoothly flaring shape, is unstable to the so-called 'irradiation instability'. But what's the outcome of such an instability? In particular, is it possible that such a disk settles into a shape that is immune to the instability? <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230916065K/abstract">In this paper</a>, we combine Athena++ with a simplified thermal treatment to show that passively heated disks settle into a 'staircase' shape. Here, the disk is punctuated by bright rings and dark gaps, with the bright rings intercepting the lion's share of stellar illumination, and the dark gaps hidden in their shadows. The optical surface of such a disk (height at which starlight is absorbed) resembles a staircase. Although our simulations do not have realistic radiative transfer, we use the RADMC3d code to show that this steady state is in good thermal equilibrium. It is possible that realistic disks reach such a state via ways not captured by our simulations. In contrast to our results here, two previous studies have claimed that irradiated disks stay smooth. We show here that they err on different issues. The staircase state, if confirmed by more sophisticated radiative hydrodynamic simulations, has a range of implications for disk evolution and planet formation.

								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162...69K/abstract">This paper</a> inestigates the relationships between planet size, stellar mass, and metallicity using planets with updated planet radii and advanced statistical methods. We looked at all Kepler planets with radii between 1 and 4 Earth radii, which includes so called super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. These two sub-populations likely have one formation mechanism, and then the bimodality of the radius distribution is carved out afterward because of the effects of intense stellar radiation. We found that the size of Kepler planets depends on the size of the star and not the metallicity. This means that planet formation depends more on the size of the protoplanetary disk, and not necessarily the amount of solids within the disk. We also found that super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are hosted by the same types of stars, which is in accordance with their formation scenario. Finally, we found that Kepler planets orbit stars that are significantly somewhat metal rich, and were able to constrain the dependency on metallicity for their occurrence rates. This project was completed under the supervision of Prof. Yanqin Wu at the University of Toronto.
